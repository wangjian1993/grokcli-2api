"""Maintainer leader election (Redis) so only one process runs background jobs.

File / single-worker mode: this process always leads.
Multi-worker + Redis: SET NX lock with periodic renew + re-election.

Critical: after a container recreate the old leader lock may still be held for
up to TTL seconds, so every worker can miss leadership at startup. We keep a
watcher that retries election and starts/stops maintainers when leadership
changes.
